## Dependencies

Requirements:
- python3.6
- numpy
- pytorch==1.1.0 and above
- [trimesh](https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh)

## Dataset preparation
We use the SMPL-NPT dataset provided by NPT, please download data from this link http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/fuyanwei/download/NeuralPoseTransfer/data/, 

## Training
The usage of our code is easy, just run the code below.
```
python train.py
```

# Evaluation

We use the same evaluation protocol as NPT for both seen and unseen settings.

Run the code below to conduct the evaluation.
```
python evaluation_NPT.py
```
